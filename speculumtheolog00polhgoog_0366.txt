fastion may very well stand with our obedience3

Christ satisfied the Law so far, asthat his righteous·

nels imputed justifies us against the Lrw, but not so

far, as that it lhould be our very sanstity and holi-

ness: for then, of imputod, it llrould become such as
the are, inherent3 which is impolsrble: in this re·
sped therefore the Law asks obedience from us,
rrrrlrr l'rrrrr llszrrrrr
Chrlst's rigahtelufilelsis so far from evacuatilrg od
obedience, that it is the grat foundation upon
which the HolySpirit, the tountain of Holiness, is
communicatod tous, as it was under the Law in
cleanfing the Leper; the holy Oyl was put upon the
Atoning Blood, Levir. 141 . So it is under the
Gospel in purifying us. rial the Blood of Christ
is sprlnlrled on ur by imputation, and then the holy
Undion, the Divlne spirit, is pourod out upon us:
were there no Atonlng blood lhod, the Holy Spi-
rit would not so much as touch upon fallen man:
were that Blood not applied to ur, theHolffSpirit
would never dwell in us as a principle-o obedi·
enee. .

Objest 8. Christs ri hteoufhesr cannot be both the
meritoriam and material cause of Justificationzfhr then
ir should be both an externa! and internal cause thrreos:
Which cannot be. Ι
