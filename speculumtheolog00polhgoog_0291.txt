Chap. 10· his modestpffl

ww fied. Now touching the efficacy of Graue, l· li
consider three things. .
1. lts effieacy as to tbe Principle of vFaith and o·
ther Graces.
· 2„ lts efficacy as to altuni believing and willing.
3. lts efficacy as to perseverance in the fitith.

The first thing is its efficacy as to the Princrple of ᾗ

Faitb, and other Graces. Bythe Principle of Faith,
lrnean not the natural power of believing. God-
doth not command us to take down theson, for
which we have no faculties3 butto believe, for which

l

’ we have an understanding and a.will; no natural fa. p
„emopculty is wanting. Hence St. Anfiin saith, the poffe of ζ

’ believing, is· of nature. This power in fain man, be·
cause in conjunnion with natural impoteney‚ never
arrives at the effe& The natural faculties are hythe

fall so vitiated, that thou h in a sense he can, yet he ¹

will not believe. Trahit ira quemqt voluptas, one lust
orotherso attolit him, that he cannot a se impetrare·

utvelit, he cannot find in his heare to do it. He bath

alind of can in his naturai faculties, but the corrup·

-, tion blasts the effen. Neither do l mean that power,

«which, aesome Divines say, is supernaturali, yet not

an'habit or vital principle of saith. Nature being

fallen, Grace (say they) givesa second power to set

the will in aequilibrio3 but that power doth not, as

an habit, incline or dispose amanto aliual believ-

ving. This power, as Itake it, is nothing but Na·

ture ¹and F ree-will. 1 see not bow it lhould be tli-
