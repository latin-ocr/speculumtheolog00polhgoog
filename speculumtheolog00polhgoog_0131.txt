Chap. 6. to life, hot he was only annnister and aType of
ννω Christ3 the Power of God did the work: but our
Saviour raised the dead by his own Divina Ponet„
Another instance is, his restoring fight to one born
blind, John 9. Touching which the blind man saith, ⁰

' Since the world began was it nordeod, that any man
oyenad the eyeraf one that was horn blind, verb 32. It

was a work fit for the Meffiah. lt is indeed stor‘ied,

that Wspafian the Emperor restored srght to the

blinda but 'rt may be the person was not really blind,

at least not naturally. Satan ( as Bellamine well
