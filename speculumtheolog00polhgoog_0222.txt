„ videnee governs the World, and all in it: heresres and
hloody persecutioni may break out as aflood, yet
Truth shall stand, and theChureh built upon it. Ina
word, seeing God is universal Governour‚·we should ,
fear him in every place, eye him in every work, sub- ·

estateand glorifie him in all his administrationi. This,

' is indeed to confeh his Kingdom which ruleth over
all, and pmdiically to own his Providence, which
sweetly and strongly disposee all things to hir own
Praise and Glory.
